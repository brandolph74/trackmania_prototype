# Unity3D Racing Prototype
Simple prototype game built for CS 4650, inspired from the Trackmania series of games. Several levels and functioning options menu. Created for desktop platforms.

Online WebGL build (contains some graphical and logic bugs from importing to newer versions in Unity/building in WebGL, but still demo-able):
